## Linear Regression 
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable X (Inputs), and the other is considered to be a dependent variable Y(Target) .

In other words, we use the model to predict the value of Y (Target) when we know the value of X (Inputs). A linear regression line has an equation of the form
### **Y = a + bX**

where 
* X is the explanatory variable, 
* Y is the dependent variable,
* b is the slope of the line, and 
* a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).

### Pros
* Simple to implement.
* Used to predict numeric values.
### Cons
* Prone to over-fitting.
* Cannot be used when the relation between independent and dependent variable are non-linear.
