Onion and garlic, both are considered superfoods due to their numerous proven health benefits. They add distinct flavours to the food and are inseparable parts of Indian cuisine. Whether you are preparing curry, stew or soup, onion and garlic are important ingredients in it. However, Ayurveda does not support the usage of these two ingredients in your diet. But what is the reason behind this?
The real reason

It is not that Ayurveda does not acknowledge the health benefits of onion and garlic. Ayurveda recognizes onions and garlic as blood purifiers. Moreover, garlic is used to prepare various ayurvedic medicines. But Ayurveda does not support their excessive usage as it considers onion as tamasic in nature (makes people irritable) and garlic to be rajsic (disturbed sleep and drained energy) in nature. As per Ayurveda, both these ingredients produce excessive heat in the body.

It is true that our body needs some heat, but excessive heat may increase the risk of other health problems. Ayurveda recommends having onion and garlic in low quantity. Ayurveda principles are mostly confused with spirituality and yoga that recommends avoiding both the ingredient as both are believed to distract a personâ€™s focus and attention. These two ingredients are even avoided by people practicing meditation or following a spiritual path, as consumptions of onion and garlic are known to increase anger, aggression, ignorance, anxiety, and increase in sexual desire.
Health benefits of onion and garlic
