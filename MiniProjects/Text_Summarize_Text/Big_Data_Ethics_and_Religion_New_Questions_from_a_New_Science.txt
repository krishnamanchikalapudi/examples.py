As any technology develops it might be expected that its increasing capabilities give rise to a succession of ethical issues, and computer technology is certainly no exception to this. Concerns which have been raised in the past include the deskilling of the workforce, increased unemployment, and the health, stress, and isolation of workers, together with issues relating to the storage of personal data in the form of databases. A further concern is the implication of computers in broadening divisions between rich and poor, through the opening up of imbalances between those who have access to computer facilities and the benefits which they bring, and those who do not. All of these concerns are ongoing. In recent years the increasingly widespread use of computers in all walks of life, from the PCs and smartphones that many consumers use on a daily basis to the supercomputers used in research programmes in astronomy, physics, and medicine, has generated the phenomenon that has become known as “big data” extremely large, often highly heterogeneous, datasets that require novel techniques and new sets of skills to interrogate them. In turn, this has led to a new set of ethical issues surrounding big data. The aim of this paper is to identify, describe, and evaluate some of these ethical issues, and to suggest ways in which some of them may be addressed. It further suggests that insights from the religious domain might be of considerable value in developing these new approaches to big data.
